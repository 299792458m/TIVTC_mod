# TIVTC v1.0.6 (20170421)

This is a moderization effort on tritical's TIVTC (v1.0.5) plugin for Avisynth

**v1.0.6 (20170421) - pinterf**
- project migrated to VS 2015
- AVS 2.6 interface, no Avisynth 2.5.x support
- some fixes
- x64 port and readability: move all inline asm to simd intrinsics or C
- supports and requires SSE2
- MMX and ISSE is not supported, but kept in the source code for reference
- source code cleanups

**v1.0.5 (2008) - tritical**
- see old readmes

Future plans: support additional color spaces, now YV12 and YUY2 is supported

All credit goes to tritical, thanks for his work.
